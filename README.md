This project is part of The Odin Project FullStack JavaScript Course and represents 35hrs of work. 
This project was a challange as it was my first time importing and exporting with Node.js and running webpacks. I can say I felt very comfortable with my ability to create and append items to DOM with javascript. However I ran into difficulty with the first attempt as I could not get the functions to work properly once exported. 

So, with a few hours of hair pulling and research, I came accross 'Sultan Badri's' approach in using innerHTML to create the items within a function. This method felt much more natural to me, as it allowed me to create essentially one function per page, exporting to the index. 

**What I learned**

- How to import and Export using Node.js
- How to work with webpacks
- How to comfortably create full pages within JavaScript
